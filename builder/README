This package contains classes to let you easily construct a new world from
scratch.

It contains builder types and methods to allow the definition and modification
of characters, zones, classes, etc. Everything required to create a fully
functional mudkip game world.

It loads/saves complete or partial world definitions to/from a json formatted
data file. This file can then be used by other tools for whatever purpose you
may require. Perhaps to exchange the world you worked so hard on with your
friends, so they may enjoy it as well.

This program initializes a datastore for a new game world.

This should be run at least once before starting the mudkip server. The server
can not run without a properly initialized datastore.

The program reads a world definition file which contains a structured layout
of everything required to create the world. It is in JSON format and can be
created either manually, or through some external build tool.

It also requires an ini configuration file much like the one for the mudkip
server. It contains the information needed to make a valid connection to a 
datastore backend. If the configuration file does not exist, this program will
create a template config in the given location. It is possible to simply supply
the same config file as you would pass to the mudkip server.

Invocation is as follows:

	$ ./mudkipb -c path/to/config.ini -w path/to/myworld.js

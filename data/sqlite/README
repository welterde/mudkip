This is the Mudkip Sqlite3 datastore implementation.
It relies on Russ Cox's gosqlite package. You can get it from:

	http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite/

This driver requires 1 initialization parameter passed into store.Open().
This should be listed in the server config file under the [data] section.
Its name is 'file'.

For example:

---[ server.ini ]---------------------------------------------------------------
[data]
file = /path/to/mystore.db
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It should be noted that Sqlite is not an ideal choice for a multi-user MUD
environment. While the sqlite engine supports multiple simultaneous users, it
behaves poorly when the application performs lots of write operations.
This happens because the engine uses the operating system's native file-locking
mechanism to ensure atomic access.

The MUD server tries to minimize the amount of writes to any datastore, but 
when using this driver, you should expect some performance problems. I have
mainly included this driver for testing. I can build and modify the datastore
interface easily without having to interact with a remote database server.

If you really want to use this for your production server, make sure to keep
the amount of concurrent users to a minimum.

This is the Mudkip Sqlite3 datastore implementation.
It relies on Russ Cox's gosqlite package. You can get it from:

	http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite/

This driver requires 1 initialization parameter passed into store.Open().
This should be listed in the server config file under the [data] section.

Its name is 'file'.

These packages are implementations of the Mudkip lib.Datastore interface.
Which one will be used depends on the DATASTORE variable in the main mudkip
makefile. It determines which datastore driver is compiled into the server.

These are works in progress and will likely change as the game develops.

Adding a new driver is relatively easy:

* Add a new directory for your driver implementation in mudkip/data/.
  Eg: mudkip/data/mydriver

* Add the appropriate code for the implementation, using mudkip/data/template/*
  as a template/guide. Also read through mudkip/data/STRUCTURE.

* Set the DATASTORE variable in mudkip/makefile to the name of your driver dir.
  Eg: DATASTORE = mydriver

* Rebuild the project.

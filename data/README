These packages are implementations of the Mudkip lib.Datastore interface.
You can specify a particular one to use for your Mudkip server in the server
config file.

These are works in progress and will likely change as the game develops.

Adding a new driver is relatively easy:

* Add a new directory for your driver implementation in mudkip/data/.
  Eg: mudkip/data/mydriver
* Add the appropriate code for the implementation, using any of the existing
  ones as a template/guide. Be sure to use the lib.RegisterStore() function
  as is demonstrated in the other datastores.
* Add your package to mudkip/data/makefile, so it will be included in the build
  process.
* Edit mudkip/server/datastores.go. Add the import for your own driver to the
  list: import _ "mudkip/mydriver". This ensures the init() code is run and the
  driver is available for use.
* Rebuild the entire project.

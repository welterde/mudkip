These packages are implementations of the Mudkip lib.Datastore interface.
You can specify a particular one to use for your Mudkip server in the server
config file.

These are works in progress and will likely change as the game develops.

Adding a new driver is relatively easy:

* Add a new directory for your driver implementation in mudkip/data/.
  Eg: mudkip/data/mydriver

* Add the appropriate code for the implementation, using mudkip/data/template/*
  as a template/guide.

* Add your package to mudkip/data/makefile, so it will be included in the build
  process. Take note that it should be added to all 3 rules (all, clean and 
  test). For example: 
 
 	all:
 		...
		make -C mydriver install
	
	clean:
		...
		make -C mydriver clean
	
	test:
		...
		make -C mydriver test


* Edit mudkip/server/datastores.go. Add the import for your own driver to the
  list: import _ "mudkip/mydriver". This ensures the init() code is run and the
  driver is available for use.

* Rebuild the entire project.

These packages are implementations of the Mudkip lib.Datastore interface.
You can specify a particular one to use for your Mudkip server in the server
config file.

These are works in progress and will likely change as the game develops.

Adding a new driver is relatively easy:

* Add a new directory for your driver implementation in mudkip/data/.
  Eg: mudkip/data/mydriver

* Add the appropriate code for the implementation, using mudkip/data/template/*
  as a template/guide.

* Set the DATASTORE variable in mudkip/makefile to the name of your driver dir.
  Eg: DATASTORE = mydriver

* Rebuild the project.

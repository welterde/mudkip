This is the mudkip server. It runs based on some profile settings you supply
through a .ini file.

Invocation is simple:

	$ ./mudkips path/to/config.ini

If the config file does not exist, mudkips will create a standard template for
you in that location and exit. You can then edit it and restart the server.

A template config file looks like this:

---------------------[ start of file ]------------------------------------------
[data]
; Any values needed to create a valid connection to the db of your choice,
; should be added in this section as key/value pairs.
; For example:
; user = bob
; pass = 1234
; dbname = mudkipz
; dbhost = 127.0.0.1

[net]
; Address should be in the format ip:port. It can be in IPv4 and IPv6 format.
; IPv6 address should be encased in brackets. For example:
; address = 127.0.0.1:54321
; address = [::1]:54321
; address = :54321
; 
; servercert and serverkey must be set when secure = true
maxclients = 32
serverkey = /path/to/key.pem
servercert = /path/to/cert.pem
secure = false
clienttimeout = 2
address =

; The logfile can be left empty if you want the server log to be written to stdout.

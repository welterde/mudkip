This is the mudkip server. It runs based on some profile settings you supply
through an ini file.

Invocation is simple:

	$ ./server path/to/config.ini

If the config file does not exist, the server will create a standard template
for you in the specified location and exit. You can then edit it and restart the
server.

An example of a standard config file can be viewed in mudkip/testdata/template.ini

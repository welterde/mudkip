This is the mudkip server. It runs based on some profile settings you supply
through an ini file.

Invocation is simple:

	$ ./server path/to/config.ini

If the config file does not exist, the server will create a standard template
for you in the specified location and exit. You can then edit it and restart the
server.

A template config file looks like this:

---------------------[ start of file ]------------------------------------------

; 
;   user = bob
;   pass = 1234
;   dbname = mudkipz
;   dbhost = 127.0.0.1
; 
; Refer to the README of the individual db driver for the required keys.

[net]

;   address = [::1]:54321
;   address = :54321

; Any values needed to create a valid connection to the db of your choice,
; should be added in this section as key/value pairs. For example:
; 
;   user = bob
;   pass = 1234
;   dbname = mudkipz
;   dbhost = 127.0.0.1
; 
; Refer to the README of the individual db driver for the required keys.

; - address should be in the format ip:port. It can be in IPv4 and IPv6 format.
;   IPv6 address should be encased in brackets. The ip can be omitted. This will
;   automatically bind the server to localhost on the given port. For example:
;  
;     address = 127.0.0.1:54321
;     address = [::1]:54321
;     address = :54321
;  
; - servercert and serverkey must be set when secure = true.
; - servername is added to a HTTP response in the Server header.
; - cookiesalt is a string of random character used to encrypt cookies.
;   Keep this value from becoming public.

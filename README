 MUDKIP
================================================================================

A Go based MUD server, client and game collection of packages.
So far it's pretty generic and not really specific to a MUD. It's just a TCP
based client/server setup. I would rather have this bit done properly before I
start with the game logic.

Check out server/main.go and client/main.go for working network examples. Run
the server first, then the client to have it connect to the server. Both require
that you supply a config file in the commandline. Run them without any arguments
to see the help on getting things started. To connect the client to the server,
you will obviously have to give them both the same IP/port to work with.

 USAGE
================================================================================

To get this project up and running, follow the steps below. This package has a
dependency on my ini-file parser package. You can get it from its git repo at
http://github.com/jteeuwen/go-pkg-ini
 
 $ cd /path/to/codedir
 $ git clone http://github.com/jteeuwen/mudkip.git
 $ cd mudkip

Optionally, modify the main makefile to set the appropriate DATASTORE value.
This value indicates which database driver to compile into the server. We opt to
make this choice at compile time to reduce the server binary size. There is no
need to have the unused drivers in there. All the drivers compile to a package
named mudkip/store.a. This is also why we can build only one of them.

 $ make

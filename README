 MUDKIP
================================================================================

A Go based MUD server, client and game collection of packages.
So far it's pretty generic and not really specific to a MUD. It's just a TCP
based client/server setup. I would rather have this bit done properly before I
start with the game logic.

Check out server/server_test.go and client/client_test.go for working
network examples. Run the server example first, then the client to have it
connect to the server.

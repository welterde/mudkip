This is a mudkip client. It runs based on some profile settings you supply
through a .ini file.

Invocation is simple:

	$ ./mudkipc path/to/config.ini

If the config file does not exist, mudkipc will create a standard template for
you in that location and exit. You can then edit it and restart the server.

A template config file looks like this:

---------------------[ start of file ]------------------------------------------
[net]
; Address should be in the format ip:port. It can be in IPv4 and IPv6 format. 
; IPv6 address should be encased in brackets. For example:
; address = 127.0.0.1:54321
; address = [::1]:54321
; address = :54321
secure = false
address = 
---------------------[ end of file ]--------------------------------------------
